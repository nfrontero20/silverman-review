Professor Bernard Silverman, Home Office Chief Scientific Advisor of the United Kingdom, is a statistician who has researched human trafficking and modern slavery in the UK.  In 2020, he published a paper titled "Multiple‚Äêsystems analysis for the quantification of modern slavery: classical and Bayesian approaches" in which he reviews existing methodologies for quantifying the scale of modern slavery and proposes a new method.  

I have written a review of this paper, titled "Review of Silverman (2020): Multiple-systems analysis for the quantification of modern slavery: classical and Bayesian approaches".  The review has seven parts, which are as follows: 

**1. Introduction:** overview of the report, motivation for the research

**2. Background:** overview of data sets, review of basic log-linear model proposed by Cormack (1989)

*3. Frequentist approaches:* summary of two frequentist approaches (stepwise parameter addition and information criterion)

*4. Existing Bayesian approaches:* summary of two common Bayesian approaches that are useful for human rights research (graphical models and dirichlet process mixtures), discussion of the performance of these approaches on his data sets

5. Bayesian-threshold approach: summary of Silverman's proposed method (Bayesian-threshold)
6. Results: main takeaways from Silverman's results
7. Conclusion: concluding thoughts

underscores how difficult it is to quantify the scale of human trafficking and modern slavery.  Since human trafficking and modern slavery are covert in nature, there is not readily available data to draw upon.
