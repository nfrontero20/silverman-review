# Review of Silverman 2020: *"Multiple-systems analysis for the quantification of modern slavery: classical and Bayesian approaches*"

Professor Bernard Silverman, Home Office Chief Scientific Advisor of the United Kingdom, is a statistician who researchs human trafficking and modern slavery.  In 2020, he published a paper titled ["Multiple‚Äêsystems analysis for the quantification of modern slavery: classical and Bayesian approaches"](https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/rssa.12505) in which he reviews existing methodologies for quantifying the scale of modern slavery and proposes a new method.  

I have written a [review of Silverman's paper](https://github.com/nfrontero20/silverman-review/blob/master/silverman-review.pdf), titled **"Review of Silverman (2020): *"Multiple-systems analysis for the quantification of modern slavery: classical and Bayesian approaches*"**.  The review has seven parts, which are as follows: 

**1. Introduction:** overview of report, motivation for the research

**2. Background:** overview of data sets, review of basic log-linear model proposed by [Cormack (1989)](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2531485?seq=1)

**3. Frequentist approaches:** summary of two frequentist approaches (stepwise parameter addition and information criterion)

**4. Existing Bayesian approaches:** summary of two common Bayesian approaches that are useful for human rights research (graphical models and dirichlet process mixtures), discussion of the performance of these approaches on Silverman's data sets

**5. Bayesian-threshold approach:** summary of Silverman's proposed method (Bayesian-threshold)

**6. Results:** main takeaways from Silverman's results

**7. Conclusion:** concluding thoughts
