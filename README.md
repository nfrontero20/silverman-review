Professor Bernard Silverman, Home Office Chief Scientific Advisor of the United Kingdom, published a paper that contributes to understanding of modern slavery in the UK.  In the paper, titled "Modern Slavery: an application of multiple systems estimation," Silverman underscores how difficult it is to quantify the scale of human trafficking and modern slavery.  Since human trafficking and modern slavery are covert in nature, there is not readily available data to draw upon.  

I have written a seven part review of Silverman's paper in which I highlight the key concepts and major takeaways from his work.  The seven sections of the review are summarized as follows: 

1. Introduction: Overview of the report, motivation for the research
2. Background: overview of data sets, review of basic log-linear model proposed by Cormack (1989)
3. Frequentist approaches: summary of two frequentist approaches, stepwise parameter addition and information criterion
4. Existing Bayesian approaches: summary of two common Bayesian approaches that are useful for human rights research, graphical models and dirichlet process mixtures; discussion of the performance of these approaches on his data sets
5. Bayesian-threshold approach: summary of Silverman's proposed method, Bayesian-threshold.
6. Results: main takeaways from Silverman's results
7. Conclusion: concluding thoughts
