  abstract = {In an effort to develop a model for estimating prevalence in a city or region of the United States, this study employed Multiple Systems Estimation, a statistical approach that uses data on known cases collected from individual agencies to estimate the number not known, with the ultimate aim of estimating the prevalence of trafficking in a region. Utilizing de-identified data provided by local non-profits and law enforcement agencies, the researchers estimated the prevalence of trafficking in the New Orleans-Metairie metropolitan statistical area. This represents one of the first attempts to use Multiple Systems Estimation to quantify human trafficking in a United States context. The article provides an account of the impediments to and limitations of conducting such an estimate, given the definitional variance and political dynamics that are endemic to anti-trafficking efforts in the United States. The authors provide recommendations for data collection and prevalence analysis that could be applied in other cities or regions of the United States as well as in other similarly-resourced environments.},

We situate our results within the framework of extended exponential families, and we exploit the geometric properties of log-linear models. We propose algorithms for extended maximum likelihood estimation that improve and correct the existing algorithms for log-linear model analysis.},

Our method, based on Dirichlet process mixtures, can accommodate complex patterns of heterogeneity of capture, and can transparently modulate its complexity without a separate model selection step. Additionally, it can handle the massively sparse contingency tables generated by large number of recaptures with moderate sample sizes. We develop an efficient and scalable MCMC algorithm for estimation. We apply our method to simulated data, and to two examples from the literature of estimation of casualties in armed conflicts.},

  abstract = {Multiple-systems estimation is a key approach for quantifying hidden populations such as the number of victims of modern slavery. The UK Government published an estimate of 10000\textendash 13000 victims, constructed by the present author, as part of the strategy leading to the Modern Slavery Act 2015. This estimate was obtained by a stepwise multiple-systems method based on six lists. Further investigation shows that a small proportion of the possible models give rather different answers, and that other model fitting approaches may choose one of these. Three data sets collected in the field of modern slavery, together with a data set about the death toll in the Kosovo conflict, are used to investigate the stability and robustness of various multiple-systems-estimate methods. The crucial aspect is the way that interactions between lists are modelled, because these can substantially affect the results. Model selection and Bayesian approaches are considered in detail, in particular to assess their stability and robustness when applied to real modern slavery data. A new Markov chain Monte Carlo Bayesian approach is developed; overall, this gives robust and stable results at least for the examples considered. The software and data sets are freely and publicly available to facilitate wider implementation and further research.},
